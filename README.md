RBG Kew Google Earth files for Reducing Plant Extinction

The URL for the original “Story Package” is https://earth.app.goo.gl/AxmXb (see also https://www.kew.org/science/who-we-are-and-what-we-do/strategic-outputs-2020/tropical-important-plant-areas ).

This link only works in Google Chrome. However, mousing over the  blue paper aeroplane icon reveals a link to the .kmz file: https://www.gstatic.com/earthfeed/content/prod/en/8944680a06a511e89ecaedf826b36103.kmz which I downloaded and expanded to get the .kml file, which can be opened in the desktop version of Google Earth.
